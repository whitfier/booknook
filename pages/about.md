Hi, I'm Cheryl Whitfield. Welcome to The Book Nook of Saugatuck! As a school librarian I've had a lifelong dream of owning a bookstore. In May 2018, that dream came true when I purchased a used bookstore in Saugatuck, MI.

The Book Nook of Saugatuck is open long weekends in the off season, and daily from May - Sept.

If you want to support our local, independent bookstore, please pay us a visit - I am sure you will enjoy it and all the other wonderful stores in Saugatuck.
